      "news_title": "Urban Company turns profitable in FY25, reports Rs 240 crore profit ahead of planned IPO",
      "news_content": "Urban Company, the home services platform founded in 2014, swung to profitability in the fiscal year ended March 2025, recording a 38.2% increase in operating revenue to Rs 1,144 crore, according to its annual financial report. The company reported a net profit of Rs 240 crore for FY25, marking a major turnaround from a loss of Rs 92.7 crore in FY24. The surge in profitability was supported by a Rs 211 crore deferred tax credit booked during the year. Even without the tax credit, Urban Company recorded a pre-tax profit of Rs 28 crore, reflecting improved operational efficiency and cost control. The Gurugram-headquartered company, which operates across India and three international markets—Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—clocked 6.8 million annual customer transactions across 17 service categories spanning spa and salon treatments, appliance repairs, pest control and more. The company reported a total net transaction value of Rs 3,115 crore for FY25. Platform-led growth and product upside Advertisment Platform services remained the company&amp;quot;s primary revenue engine, contributing nearly 65% to overall operating income, which rose to Rs 742 crore, up 32.5% from the previous year. While its customer membership revenue posted a modest increase of 7.7% to Rs 98 crore, a standout was the threefold surge in revenue from its Native-branded water purifiers—Rs 116 crore in FY25, up from Rs 29 crore in FY24. Sales of products to service professionals generated another Rs 188 crore. Urban Company reported that its India operations alone contributed Rs 997 crore to the topline, while international markets brought in Rs 147 crore. An additional Rs 117 crore came from interest income and mutual fund realizations, taking total income for FY25 to Rs 1,261 crore—up from Rs 928 crore in the previous fiscal. Cost discipline yields profitability Total expenses rose to Rs 1,223 crore, compared with Rs 1,021 crore in FY24. However, the company held steady on its largest cost heads: employee benefit expenses, at Rs 350 crore, remained flat year-on-year and included Rs 72.5 crore in non-cash ESOP costs. Advertising and business promotion outlays were unchanged at Rs 207 crore. India&amp;quot;s consumer services vertical emerged as the profit engine, generating Rs 113 crore in profits. Losses from the water purifier segment and international operations stood at Rs 38.7 crore and Rs 33.7 crore, respectively. IPO filing and strategic expansion With profitability in hand, Urban Company is preparing to go public. In April, the company filed its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for a Rs 1,900 crore public issue, comprising a Rs 429-crore fresh issue and a Rs 1,471-crore offer for sale by existing shareholders. This represents a trimmed-down version of the earlier Rs 3,000-crore plan. Among its recent initiatives is &amp;quot;InstaHelp,&amp;quot; a quick commerce-like service for on-demand domestic help, launched in March and now operational with about 25-30 minutes fulfillment timeline. Under its Native product label, Urban Company also expanded into smart locks, further building its product-led revenue portfolio.",

      "news_title": "NBFC firm Techfino raises Rs 65 crore in equity round to boost MSME lending",
      "news_content": "Non-banking finance company Techfino has raised Rs 65 crore in equity funding led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Saison Capital, the venture investment arm of Tokyo-listed Credit Saison. The Bengaluru-based lender plans to use the capital to expand its secured lending operations focused on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in India&amp;quot;s semi-urban and rural regions. The investment will help the firm double its physical footprint—from 30 to 60 branches—over the next 12 months, bolster its workforce, and further develop its proprietary credit risk assessment technology tailored for India&amp;quot;s informal economy. “We&amp;quot;ve been profitable since our first full year of operations, and our core strength has been a tight grip on asset quality,” said Rajesh Panda, Co-founder of Techfino. “This fundraise is purely equity and will be used to drive growth through branch-led expansion and people hiring, especially for our MSME loan against property business.” Founded in 2019 by a trio of former banking executives—Panda (ex-Standard Chartered), Jayaprakash Patra (ex-ICICI, ING), and Ratikant Satapathy (ex-Bajaj Finance)—Techfino operates two primary lending verticals: unsecured education loans offered in partnership with over 100 institutions, and secured loans for MSEs, primarily in tier 2 and 3 cities. Advertisment With an asset under management (AUM) of about Rs 225 crore, including Rs 100 crore in its loan against property (LAP) portfolio, Techfino currently disburses more than Rs 10 crore in secured loans monthly—a figure it expects to double following the latest funding. The average LAP ticket size ranges between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, offered to small retailers, dairy farmers, and informal traders across Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. Unlike traditional models, Techfino evaluates household-level income, factoring in earnings of multiple family members—a practice particularly relevant in India&amp;#x27;s fragmented rural income landscape. “Our typical borrower may be running a small grocery store while another family member works in a private firm. We assess household income holistically and build region-specific underwriting scorecards,” said Satapathy. The firm attributes much of its scalability to its tech infrastructure, which integrates APIs for banking data, property verification, and legal checks. “We&amp;quot;ve built proprietary scorecards for property, bureau, and banking data and have embedded legal checks into the system. This allows us to underwrite rural borrowers with the same speed and precision as urban fintechs,” Satapathy added. To date, Techfino has disbursed over one lakh loans across both its verticals and counts DCB Bank among its previous backers. The company closed FY25 with total revenue of Rs 34 crore and profit before tax of Rs 1.5 crore. It currently employs about 400 staff and plans to increase headcount to 600 by the end of this year. While its education financing segment continues to operate profitably through institutional tie-ups with universities such as Manipal and Amity, the firm is increasingly focused on its secured portfolio. “Education lending will continue at a steady pace, but we see humongous growth ahead in MSME LAP. That&amp;quot;s where we&amp;quot;re doubling down,” Panda said.",

      "news_title": "Operant AI unveils MCP Gateway to secure emerging runtime AI workflows",
      "news_content": "Ashley Roof, Dr. Priyanka Tembey, Vrajesh Bhavsar, Co-founders, Operant AI\n\nOperant AI, the cybersecurity firm behind the AI Gatekeeper platform, has launched MCP Gateway, a significant upgrade aimed at protecting artificial intelligence systems built on the rapidly spreading Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nMCP Gateway is positioned as the first enterprise-grade solution providing real-time, active-blocking security for AI workflows that leverage open-source MCP servers and agents. This development arrives amid a surge in MCP adoption—more than 1,000 servers are currently deployed globally—and rising cybersecurity concerns around AI tool integration.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol has emerged as a key infrastructure layer for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interact with APIs, databases, and software tools securely. According to Gartner, by 2026, up to 75% of API gateway vendors and half of iPaaS providers are expected to incorporate MCP features. In India alone, where the AI market is forecast to reach \\$17 billion by 2027 per NASSCOM, adoption is growing across IT services, financial technology, and healthcare.\n\nYet, the proliferation of MCP-aligned agents and tools has introduced complex new threats. These include prompt injection attacks, data leakage, and shadow AI deployments. A particularly worrying vector is inter-agent spoofing—where one compromised AI agent may mislead others across interconnected systems. Operant AI argues that conventional cybersecurity tools, designed for static environments, are ill-equipped to handle these dynamic, modular AI architectures.\n\n“While MCP is a powerful AI integration framework, the growing adoption of open-source MCP servers also brings new challenges around security and governance,” said Vrajesh Bhavsar, CEO and co-founder of Operant AI. “Many organizations are deploying these tools without full visibility into their behavior, data access, or usage. MCP Gateway helps close this gap by providing enhanced security, observability, and control across the MCP ecosystem.”\n\nThe product offers a triad of capabilities:\n\nOperant AI is also rolling out a partner program to integrate MCP Gateway with existing AI infrastructure vendors. This co-development model is meant to embed runtime security capabilities directly into partner offerings.\n\nAshley Roof, co-founder and CMO, said the company’s approach draws on its earlier go-to-market strategies with model providers: “We’re not just securing MCP applications—we’re enabling the entire ecosystem.”\n\nMCP Gateway is available as part of Operant’s broader AI Gatekeeper suite and supports deployment across major cloud platforms, including AWS Bedrock, Azure, and Google Vertex AI.\n\nFounded by veterans from Apple, VMware, and Google, Operant AI is backed by Felicis Ventures and SineWave. The firm has been recognized by Gartner in its Market Guide for AI Trust, Risk, and Security Management (AI TRiSM) as a representative vendor.",

      "news_title": "Bengaluru-based electric motorcycle maker Oben Electric raises Rs 50 crore",
      "news_content": "Oben Electric, the Bengaluru-based electric motorcycle manufacturer, has raised Rs 50 crore in an extended Series A funding round, doubling its total Series A haul to Rs 100 crore. With this infusion, the startup&amp;#x27;s overall capital raised stands at Rs 200 crore. The latest round, which follows a similar Rs 50 crore raise in January 2025, saw participation from existing investors as well as new backers including Helios Holdings, the Sharda Family Office, and the Kay Family. The fresh capital, the startup said, will be deployed to scale its retail footprint, accelerate manufacturing, and broaden its product portfolio to target mass-market affordability. “The extended Series A funding is a strong vote of confidence from our investors and comes at a time when our momentum is accelerating nationwide,” said Madhumita Agrawal, Founder and CEO of Oben Electric. “We&amp;#x27;re expanding not just our retail footprint but also our innovation roadmap with platforms like O100 that aim to democratize electric motorcycles for the mass market.” Advertisment Since the initial Series A raise, Oben has moved quickly to expand its reach, launching 37 retail outlets across 26 cities in 13 states—including Punjab, Gujarat, Telangana, and Odisha. The new funding will support a further scale-up to over 150 showrooms across 50 cities by fiscal year 2026, the startup said, while also enhancing after-sales infrastructure and expanding production capacity at its Bengaluru facility. A key highlight of Oben&amp;quot;s upcoming roadmap is the development of the &amp;#x27;O100&amp;#x27; platform—an electric motorcycle line priced below Rs 1 lakh, designed to appeal to price-sensitive Indian consumers seeking performance and durability. The startup emphasized that its vertical integration strategy—covering in-house development of batteries, motors, and control units—has enabled tighter control over costs and quality. Sandesh from Sharda family office, said, &amp;quot;Oben Electric had the right technology, product‑market fit and growth indicators. Their vertical integration of critical EV components like LFP batteries, motors and control units, combined with the founders&amp;quot; maturity, positions them to build India&amp;quot;s first global electric motorcycle brand.&amp;quot; Oben&amp;quot;s current lineup includes the Rorr and its entry-level variant Rorr EZ, both targeted at urban commuters. The Rorr EZ starts at Rs 99,999 for the 2.6 kWh base variant (IDC range ≈ 110 km) and goes up to Rs 1,29,999 for the 4.4 kWh top variant (IDC range ≈ 175 km); a mid-spec 3.4 kWh version priced at Rs 1,19,999 offers ~140 km. All three variants share a 95 km/h top speed and 0-40 km/h in 3.3 seconds. The startup is now preparing for its Series B funding round, targeting $30 million later in 2025. Proceeds from that round are expected to fuel international expansion and extend the product pipeline as Oben Electric seeks to become a global player in two-wheeler electric mobility—“Designed in India for the World.”",

The startup is strategically focusing on the United States, where childcare providers face intensifying operational strain and workforce challenges. As dual-income households become the norm, demand for dependable childcare has surged. Yet many providers still grapple with thin margins, staffing gaps, and manual systems. illumine said it is closing this gap by replacing spreadsheets and fragmented tools with a modern, AI-powered infrastructure. “Parents invest thousands of dollars annually in their children&amp;#x27;s early education, yet the childcare industry remains surprisingly underserved by modern technology. This results in a frustrating experience for parents, teachers get bogged down in administrative tasks instead of focusing on education, and centers miss out on growth opportunities,” said Shripati Acharya, Partner at Prime Venture Partners. “We are excited to back the illumine team which is transforming this space with their AI-first vertical solution that simplifies every aspect of running a childcare center while improving outcomes for children, parents, and educators alike.” Advertisment Co-founded in 2018 by Navneet Rastogi, Purva Goyal, and Sourabh Agarwal, the platform&amp;quot;s proprietary AI automates lesson planning, manages staff schedules, and enables multilingual communication with families, giving owners access to real-time business intelligence they can act on. “Our AI understands educator workflows and language,” said the CEO. “That&amp;quot;s the difference. This isn&amp;quot;t generic software — it&amp;quot;s a co-pilot in the classroom and a control panel for owners who need better visibility to grow.” Now used in 56 countries, including the US, Southeast Asia, the UAE, and Europe, illumine plans to use its new capital to deepen U.S. expansion, accelerate product development, and integrate with local regulatory systems. The startup claims to have achieved nearly 200% year-over-year revenue growth and a churn rate below 1%. Unlike others, illumine offers a fully integrated platform that combines enrollment, compliance, billing, parent engagement, curriculum design, and operational analytics. The system is especially effective for multi-site organizations that need unified oversight.",

HealthQuad Fund III builds upon the success of its predecessors, Funds I and II, which backed more than 18 tech-enabled healthcare ventures across diagnostics, mental health, e-pharmacy, and data analytics.

      "news_title": "OnePlus India Audit Flags Compliance & Operational Issues",
      "news_content": "Amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese firms in India, OnePlus Technology India has come under the radar after auditors flagged several compliance and operational issues, including the use of foreign-hosted accounting software, program codes in a foreign language and delayed provident fund contributions. As per OnePlus India’s standalone financial report filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), OnePlus is currently addressing these concerns. The filing added that OnePlus is updating its IT systems. “The management will also test the new system to confirm that the audit trail has been enabled and make available such a report to the auditor along with the necessary access to independently test the same during the financial year 2024-25,” the company said. It further said that the company has taken the steps for making the outstanding payment of contribution in the employee provident fund for the year 23-24. The filing appended the auditor’s report that flagged the risk of potential action from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Income Tax Department. The filing dated May 27 noted, “Accounting software used by the company for preparation and maintenance of its books of account has been hosted on physical servers located outside of India. Further, the program codes were maintained in a foreign language which posed significant limitations in the ability to test such codes and further due to absence of Service Organisation Control Type 2 (SOC 2)/SAE 3402, ‘Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization’ the auditors were unable to comment on the audit trail feature of the accounting software.” The auditors noted that OnePlus’s accounting software is hosted on servers maintained by Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp in Dongguan, China. The use of program codes in a foreign language (presumably Chinese) hampered audit procedures related to code testing, security, and compliance. Additionally, the absence of SOC 2 or SAE 3402 certifications prevented the auditors from verifying the presence of a compliant audit trail. Shah &amp; Jain Chartered Accountants serves as the statutory auditor for OnePlus India, while Grant Thornton Bharat LLP is the internal auditor. The filing did not clarify whether both or only one of them flagged the issues. Notably, OPPO, OnePlus’s parent company, had previously come under ED scrutiny in 2021 for alleged money laundering, tax evasion, and regulatory violations. Chinese firms then reportedly faced fines of around INR 1,000 Cr for such infractions. Regulatory pressure on Chinese smartphone companies in India has intensified since border tensions between the two nations escalated in 2020. Xiaomi, another Chinese brand, told Indian authorities last year that the heightened scrutiny had made component suppliers hesitant to invest in India. Despite these issues, OnePlus Technology India reported operating revenue of INR 15,217 Cr and a net profit of INR 230 Cr for FY24. However, these numbers are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the company’s business structure in June 2023.",

      "news_content": "Jumping on the satellite communications (satcom) bandwagon, Vodafone Idea (Vi) has announced a partnership with US-based AST SpaceMobile to launch direct-to-device satellite broadband services in the country. As part of the collaboration, Vi will leverage AST SpaceMobile’s satellite constellation to offer voice, video, data streaming and internet access to customers in areas with sparse terrestrial mobile infrastructure. Simply put, Vi users will be able to access high-speed internet on standard smartphones in areas with coverage gaps without the need for any specialised equipment. The deal will see the two companies working together to design, implement and launch the new system. In a statement, Vi said that while AST SpaceMobile will develop, manufacture and manage the satellite constellation, the telecom operator will oversee terrestrial network integration, operating spectrum and market access. “Vi has always been committed to leveraging technology to connect every Indian and we see satellite communication as a complement to terrestrial connectivity. As satellite-based mobile access becomes a reality in India, we are looking forward to ushering in a new era of seamless and resilient connectivity,” said Vi chief marketing officer Avneesh Khosla. Commenting on the partnership, AST SpaceMobile chief commercial officer Chris Ivory said, “... Together with Vodafone Idea, we are excited to unlock new possibilities for emergency response, disaster management, agriculture, remote learning, and countless other applications that will benefit from truly ubiquitous mobile broadband”. Besides, Vi also said that the two companies will also jointly collaborate on developing commercial offerings for consumer and enterprise use cases as well as the internet of things (loT) sector. This comes at a time when the government has pushed the pedal on satcom rollout. Last month, telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that India will see the fastest rollout of the satcom network in the world. On the regulatory front, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has forwarded its recommendations on norms for satcom spectrum, with the Centre now vetting the policy. Meanwhile, competition also continues to intensify in the homegrown satcom space. In May, Starlink was granted a letter of intent by the telecom department (DoT) to operate satellite-based internet services in India. Quickly afterwards, the Elon Musk-led company also received another licence from the telecom ministry. Alongside, Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance-backed Jio SES too have received GMPCS licence from regulators and are waiting for approvals to commence commercial operations in the country. Then, there are global giants like Amazon’s Project Kuiper and Apple vendor Globalstar that have also filed applications for satcom licences in the country.",

      "news_title": "The Otipy Collapse, Urban Company’s Profitable FY25 & More",
      "news_content": "How Otipy Ran Out of Stock Once a disruptor in the realm of the agritech sector with its fresh-from-farm model, Otipy’s end is as ironic as it can get. Well, the startup that raised $70 Mn from VCs like WestBridge Capital, Omidyar in its five-year lifespan couldn’t help but fall to the ground as quick commerce players uprooted it with speed, scale and instant gratification. So, how did one of the pioneers of India’s farm-to-fork startup ecosystem crumble? The Flawed Fundamentals: Even with the massive funding, the capital-intensive nature of last-mile delivery, razor-thin margins on fresh produce, and the unmanageable nature of demand forecasting in perishable categories brought down Otipy’s house of cards. The Quick Commerce Blow: Otipy, which connected end consumers to farmers through a community of resellers, gained initial traction on the back of customers willing to wait for quality produce. However, the startup’s unit economics, user retention and sales went for a toss as Otipy’s limited product range and longer delivery timelines were bound to lose against 10-minute apps. Even as the company’s leadership explored pivoting to faster deliveries, what proved to be the death knell for Otipy was the lack of capital, logistics complexities and higher wastage risks that come with speed. Vendors Grilled In The Grind: Left in the lurch are the company’s suppliers, who are yet to receive their payments since January. Furthermore, Otipy’s management has halted all communication with their employees, offering them no clarity on when their dues will be settled. The shocking demise of Otipy, following rival Deep Rooted quietly calling it quits, has raised questions about the sustainability of the farm-to-table model. Besides, many that are operational, Waycool and DeHaat, are in deep waters due to operational issues, rising debts and layoffs. While that is a topic for yet another day, here’s how Otipy ran out of stock. From The Editor’s Desk Urban Company’s Profitable FY25: The IPO-bound hyperlocal services startup reported a net profit of INR 239.7 Cr in FY25 against a loss of INR 92.7 Cr in the previous fiscal. Operating revenue jumped 38.2% YoY to INR 1,144.4 Cr in the fiscal under review. WIOM Nets $35 Mn: The telecom startup has raised the funds in a round co-led by Accel and Prosus at a valuation of $200 Mn. The startup provides affordable and unlimited internet services to middle and lower-middle-income households under the PM-WANI Scheme. BlueStone Eyes Unicorn Tiara: The IPO-bound jewellery brand is looking to raise INR 300 Cr to INR 350 Cr at a valuation of $1.15 Bn. Meanwhile, existing backers 360 One and Centrum Wealth are also looking to sell their stakes. BlueStone has filed its DRHP to raise INR 1,000 Cr. Physis Capital's INR 400 Cr Fund: The VC firm has raised over INR 200 Cr for its maiden fund, which aims to back 20 startups operating in the edtech, fintech, and consumer services spaces. The fund will dish out cheques in the range of $1 Mn to $1.5 Mn. Ex-Unacademy Exec’s New Venture: Former chief business officer of Unacademy Abhinav Agarwal is launching a new startup in the eyewear space. The new venture has already raised $2.2 Mn seed funding in a round led by India Quotient. Oben’s INR 100 Cr Fundraise: The electric bike maker has marked the final close of its $11 Mn Series A funding round, which saw participation from Helios Holdings, Sharda family office, and others. The company designs and manufactures EV motorcycles and EV components. ArisInfra’s IPO Day 1: The B2B ecommerce startup’s public issue was subscribed 24% on the first day, led by strong demand from retail investors. Meanwhile, NIIs bid for 6.9 Lakh shares as against the 35.68 Lakh shares reserved for them, resulting in 19% subscription. Ola Mulls Subscription Model For Drivers: Drivers at the ride-hailing unicorn can avail the benefits of a zero-commission model after subscribing to its 30-day pass for INR 67 a day. The startup will join the ranks of Rapido and Namma Yatri that introduced the zero commission model. Inc42 Startup Spotlight Can bbsAI Power India’s Multilingual Tech Future While there is a surplus of AI offerings and datasets in English, there seems to be an acute dearth of such critical tools in Indic languages. Realising that it posed a challenge for building localised AI solutions, Ganesh Arnaal and Ganesh Ramakrishnan founded bbsAI in 2023. India’s Indic AI Future: The Mumbai-based startup is focussed on building India-focussed AI infrastructure. Its Udaan Translation Engine offers translation and document processing in multiple Indic languages, while ABAACU and bbsHindiOffice support everything from government communication to enterprise workflows. The SLM Approach: Instead of deploying a large language model, bbsAI’s unique approach is built on leveraging small language models that focus on explainability and reliability by design. While there are existing players like Synthesia.io, Lilt, and DeepL making waves in the space, bbsAI has much room to grow in India’s GenAI market, which is expected to become a $17 Bn opportunity by 2027. Can bbsAI be the missing piece in India's Indic AI future?",

      "news_title": "SEBI Overhauls Norms To Boost Startup IPOs & Reverse Flipping",
      "news_content": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) board has approved a slew of amendments to boost Indian startup listings and promote reverse flipping. At the 210th meeting in Mumbai, the market regulator’s board gave its nod to a proposal allowing startup founders to retain their stock options (issued a year prior to the IPO) even after their companies are listed, with certain caveats. “The proposal approved by the board shall facilitate founders who received such benefits at least one year prior to the filing of DRHP with the board, to continue holding, and / or exercising such benefits even after being specified as the promoter/s and the company becoming a listed entity,” the SEBI said in a statement. Currently, founders are classified as promoters at the time of filing DRHP, making them ineligible for employee stock option plans (ESOPs). As such, promoters are required to liquidate these stock options before listing. Meanwhile, in a move aimed at fostering reverse flipping of startups, SEBI also extended the scope of relaxation pertaining to a minimum holding period of one year (for shares acquired following an approved scheme) to be eligible for the offer for sale (OFS) component. Post the amendment, the regulator has made the exemption available for shares from conversion of compulsorily convertible securities (CCS) issued under such an approved scheme. “This (non-exemption for CCS) has resulted in certain investors not being able to participate in the offer for sale in public issue. Extending the exemption to equity shares arising from conversion of fully paid-up CCS received pursuant to approved scheme will facilitate such participation. This will assist the companies contemplating reverse flipping,” said SEBI. SEBI also approved a proposal to allow alternative investment funds (AIFs) and foreign venture capital funds (holding at least 5% of the post-issue capital or any entity forming part of promoter group other than the promoter(s)) to contribute equity shares arising from conversion of CCS towards the minimum promoter contribution requirement, apart from the promoters. SEBI’s Boost For Co-Investment Opportunities The regulator’s board also gave its nod to a proposal to permit Category I and Category II AIFs to offer co-investment (CIV) schemes. For context, co-investment allows certain AIF investors to buy additional shares in startups in their individual capacity, besides investing in the company through the fund. “A separate CIV scheme shall be launched for each co-investment in an investee company subject to safeguards to ensure that the scheme is used only for bonafide purposes… Certain regulatory requirements applicable to other AIF schemes shall be relaxed for CIV schemes… This policy initiative will allow Category I &amp; II AIFs to facilitate co-investment to accredited investors through CIV scheme within AIF Regulations, in addition to the existing option for co-investment available through the PMS route,” said SEBI. Commenting on the development, SKG investment &amp; Advisory director Kush Gupta said that the move will bolster funding opportunities for startups and provide fund managers with additional capital. “SEBI’s board meeting today marked an important step for asset management companies as the regulator decided to provide flexibility to AIFs… This will attract more investments in this asset class and provide opportunities to the sophisticated investor to participate with more conviction… It will provide fund managers with additional capital to look for more investment opportunities and deliver better on their performance,” added Gupta. SEBI Tweaks Angel Fund Rules SEBI’s board also approved a proposal to overhaul the regulatory framework for Angel Funds under AIF regulations to enhance the “ease of doing business”. Under the new rules, angel investors will now have to be registered as “accredited investors”. Angel backers will now have to independently verify their investor status in line with thresholds that align with market levels. Additionally, the board also approved a proposal to amend existing rules to include qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) “for the limited purpose of investments into Angel Funds only”. Key features of the new regime include: Relaxation of floor for investment in a company to INR 10 Lakh from INR 25 Lakh previously. Similarly, the cap has been raised to INR 25 Cr from INR 10 Cr earlier Removal of concentration limit of 25% of total investments of angel funds in an investee company Allowing contributions from more than 200 accredited investors in an investment Enabling follow-on investment in an investee company which is no longer a startup Sponsor/ manager shall maintain a minimum continuing interest in each investment of the angel fund, at higher of 0.5% of investment amount or INR 50,000 For context, angel funds involve hundreds of wealthy individuals pooling their investments with other angels through private networks to make investments in startups. These investments are routed by registering with SEBI as AIFs. These were an attractive proposition as investments made via SEBI-registered angel funds were exempt from angel tax. The dreaded tax was abrogated by finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2024-25 speech. More Relief For VCs With an eye on aiding settlements of violations stemming from not migrating to the new AIF framework within the prescribed time frame, SEBI has also introduced a one-time settlement scheme for VC firms. It is pertinent to note that VC funds, previously registered under the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996, had to transition to the new regime by July 19, 2025 by specifically registering as a Category I AIF. Under the amnesty scheme for funds that have already completed their migration to the new rules, the erring parties will have to pay INR 1 Lakh for delay of up to one year in winding up the scheme and INR 50,000 for every subsequent year. Additionally, the VCs will also be liable for an amount ranging between INR 1 Lakh to INR 6 Lakh depending on the cost of unliquidated investments as on the date of application for migration. SEBI also said that the settlement amount and all expenses related to the settlement will be borne by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund. It has set a deadline of January 19, 2025 as the late date of applying for the settlement scheme (six months from the last date to apply for migration). “... Migration to AIF Regulations would help the VCFs to secure an additional liquidation period to liquidate the assets and wind up the schemes. However, such migration would not absolve the VCFs from their past delays for winding up such schemes. The Scheme is intended to provide expeditious settlement of the past non-compliance related to tenure of scheme only, without any additional burden to investors,” SEBI added.",

      "news_title": "Elon Musk’s Starlink Gets Key Licence To Operate In India",
      "news_content": "Update | June 19, 02:08 AM Weeks after a report claimed that Elon Musk’s Starlink had received a licence from the telecom ministry, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has confirmed the development. In a post on X, Scindia said that SpaceX president and chief operating officer (COO) Gwynne Shotwell “appreciated the licence” granted to Starlink. This came during a meeting between the minister and Shotwell, where they discussed opportunities for collaboration in the satcom space. “Had a productive meeting with Ms. @Gwynne_Shotwell, President &amp; COO of @SpaceX, on India’s next frontier in connectivity. We delved into opportunities for collaboration in satellite communications to power Digital India’s soaring ambitions and empower every citizen across the country… Ms. Shotwell appreciated the license granted to @Starlink, calling it a great start to the journey,” the post by Scindia read. Original | June 6, 04:21 PM Elon Musk-led Starlink has received a key licence from the telecom ministry, paving the way for it to offer satellite communication services in India, Reuters reported. With this, Starlink becomes the third satcom company after Eutelsat's OneWeb and Reliance Jio to be granted the crucial licence. The next steps for Starlink include obtaining approvals from the Indian space regulator IN-SPACe and securing spectrum allocation before it can begin commercial operations. This comes after the company secured a conditional nod to operate satellite-based internet services in India, receiving a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Starlink is Musk’s satellite internet service that constitutes a constellation of over 7,000 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, a number expected to rise past 40,000 in the coming years. Unlike traditional geostationary satellite services, which orbit at least 30,000 kilometres above the Earth, Starlink’s satellites orbit closer to Earth (around 550km), significantly reducing latency and enabling services like HD video streaming, online gaming and video conferencing even in remote areas. Its other competitors, like Amazon’s Project Kuiper, are still awaiting similar license. Since it began operations in 2019, Starlink has changed internet connectivity around the world. Back in 2021-2022, Starlink made an attempt to enter the Indian market by opening up pre-orders for its high-speed satellite internet services. The move attracted significant interest from Indian consumers, particularly those in underserved and remote regions. However, Indian authorities stepped in and flagged that Starlink lacked the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in the country. The company was forced to refund customers and shelve its expansion plans. While Indian telecom giants Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries Ltd had long opposed Starlink’s entry in India, but later both inked deals with SpaceX to bring Starlink’s broadband services to their Indian customers. Starlink’s commercial viability in India still remains uncertain with pricing being a key concern. Industry estimates suggest that Starlink’s monthly subscription costs could range between INR 3,000 and INR 7,000, depending on the plan and region. In addition, customers would have to bear a one-time cost of INR 20,000 to INR 35,000 for the user terminal kit, which includes a satellite dish and Wi-Fi router. According to a Jefferies report, Starlink may also adopt a premium pricing model in India due to its limited bandwidth capacity, a move that could further restrict its accessibility in price-sensitive markets. Meanwhile, regulatory complexities continue to evolve. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has proposed a five-year cap on satellite broadband permits, citing the need to evaluate the sector’s progress before allowing long-term commitments. Starlink, on the other hand, is lobbying for a 20-year license, pointing out the long gestation and capital-intensive nature of its operations. Addressing concerns around potential market disruption, Union Minister Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani recently downplayed the impact of Starlink’s entry. He noted that the company’s global user base remains under 5 Mn and emphasised that satellite internet continues to be significantly more expensive and slower than traditional telecom networks. To add another layer of scrutiny, the DoT introduced new security guidelines for satellite communication players last month, tightening compliance requirements for global firms entering the Indian market.",

      "news_content": "About two months after announcing its plans to acquire Jio Payments Bank Ltd (JPBL), fintech company Jio Financial Services (JFS) has completed the acquisition for INR 104.5 Cr. In an exchange filing, JFS said it bought 7.91 Cr shares of JPBL from State Bank of India (SBI), making the payments bank its wholly owned subsidiary. In March, the company had said it would buy SBI's complete stake in the bank in a deal for INR 13.22 per share. During JFS’ Q4 earnings call, its CEO Hitesh Sethia said that JPBL had been seeing substantial growth in its customer base. “JPBL has seen substantial growth in its customer base which has tripled year-on-year to 2.31 Mn and deposits also has tripled to INR 295 Cr. In March this year, we signed an agreement to acquire State Bank of India’s remaining stake in Jio Payments Bank,” he added. The bank’s product portfolio includes CASA variants, including sweep and salary accounts, physical and virtual debit cards, wallets, domestic money transfer and Aadhaar-enabled payment systems. In Q4 FY25, Jio Payments Bank expanded its network of business correspondents (BC) to 14,000+, an over six-fold increase over FY24, the company claimed. On the UPI front, JPBL processed 4.08 Mn transactions worth INR 318.20 Cr in the month of March and was the 30th most used UPI app. JPBL was set up in 2016 as a joint venture between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and SBI, with the former holding 77% stake in the digital bank. RIL had received a licence to run a payments bank from the RBI in August 2015. JPBL officially commenced its banking operations in April, 2018, becoming the sixth payments bank to go live in India. In 2023, RIL demerged its financial services business, JFS, into a separate entity for a subsequent listing. JFS inherited RIL's stake in Jio Payments Bank. In August 2024, JFS increased its stake in JPBL to 82.17% by purchasing 6.8 Cr equity shares from SBI for INR 68 Cr. Besides banking, JFS provides lending solutions (Jio Finance Ltd), payments solutions (Jio Payment Solutions Ltd), and insurance services (Jio Insurance Broking Ltd). Last month, Jio BlackRock Asset Management received SEBI’s approval to commence operations. Earlier this month, Jio BlackRock Investment Advisors received the regulator’s nod to operate as an investment advisor.",

      "news_title": "Exclusive: Ex-Unacademy CBO Abhinav Agarwal’s New Eyewear Startup Raises $2.2 Mn",
      "news_content": "Serial entrepreneur and former Unacademy CBO Abhinav Agarwal is launching a new startup in the eyewear space and has raised $2.2 Mn seed funding in a round led by India Quotient. Agarwal told Inc42 that the funding round also saw participation from notable angle investors such as Unacademy’s Gaurav Munjal and Roman Saini, CRED’s Kunal Shah, Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, V3 Ventures’ Arjun Vaidya, Offline’s Utsav Somani, Urban Company’s Abhiraj Singh Bahl, CoinDCX’s Sumit Gupta and Neeraj Khandelwal, Redbus' Phanindra Sama and former Deutsche Bank CEO Dilipkumar Khandelwal. The startup, which is in stealth mode currently, will utilise the capital for product research, brand building, team hiring, and building inventory. Agarwal worked with Unacademy for almost a year as a CBO after his company SwifLearn was acquired by the edtech major in 2021. Prior to that, he cofounded DoorMint, which shut operations in 2017. Commenting on the new venture, Agarwal said there is a need to improve the eyewear quality in the country. “We won’t compromise on the quality, design, lens, and the experience. This is what our focus is,” he said. The startup plans to sell its products via its own website as well as offline stores. Its formal launch is expected in the next few months, along with the opening of its first retail outlet. “Retail outlets will be a core strategy for us as users like to visit stores to try on spectacles and get eye checkups done. This will also result in conversion and we will also get on spot feedback,” Agarwal said, who has been working on this startup since the start of this year. The startup’s website, which is currently under development, will offer a virtual try-on feature. Responding to a question on the competition, the founder said that there is a gap in the market as quality products are currently available only at premium price points. “So there’s a gap. This is where we come in,” he added. He further noted that while eyewear was once seen as a utility item, it has now evolved into a blend of utility and fashion –becoming an extension of one’s personality. With rising income levels in the country, the spending on eyewear has also gone up. This, Agarwal said, provides a big opportunity. As per Statista, the Indian eyewear market is estimated to generate a revenue of $6.24 Bn in 2025 and this is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.26% till 2029. However, Agarwal’s new startup will have to compete with established new-age tech players like IPO-bound Lenskart and ClearDekho, which was recently acquired by Jaipuria Group. In the traditional space, the startup will compete with the likes of Titan, Himalayan Eyewear, Dayal Opticals, among others.",

      "news_title": "IPO-bound Urban Company turns profitable in FY25, revenue grows 38%",
      "news_content": "Home service marketplace Urban Company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 239.8 crore in FY25, swinging into the black from a Rs 92.7 crore loss in the previous year. The company&rsquo;s revenue from operations rose 38.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,144.5 crore, driven by growth in its India and international businesses. A significant portion of the net profit gain was attributed to recognition of deferred tax assets worth Rs 211 crore during the year, in addition to improved cost efficiency and operating leverage. &amp;quot;The improvement in profitability was primarily driven by the P&amp;amp;amp;L credit attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax asset amounting to Rs 2,112.12 Million in the year ended March 31, 2025,&amp;quot; the report notes. The services marketplace reported an adjusted EBITDA of Rs 11.1 crore, against a loss of Rs 119 crore in FY24. Profit before tax stood at Rs 28.6 crore. The numbers come as the Gurugram-headquartered company prepares for its market debut. In April, Urban Company filed its draft papers for a Rs 1,900-crore IPO, comprising a Rs 429-crore fresh issue and a Rs 1,471 crore offer for sale by shareholders. The company also converted into a public limited firm earlier this year and issued bonus shares at a 2,499:1 ratio in February, substantially increasing its share base ahead of listing, the report said. India business Urban Company&rsquo;s India consumer services business brought in Rs 881.4 crore in revenue, up 24.2 percent. Net transaction value (NTV) from the India segment stood at Rs 2,667.2 crore, with 82 percent of it driven by repeat users. The average number of monthly transacting service professionals in India stood at 45,619 in FY25. Professionals earned an average of Rs 26,407 a month after costs, with top performers earning up to Rs 49,000, it said. Native and international segments The company&rsquo;s hardware vertical Native, which sells smart door locks and RO purifiers, recorded Rs 116 crore in revenue, up over 3x from the previous year. The segment, which the company had entered back in FY23, contributed Rs 155.5 crore in NTV and continues to scale rapidly, with water purifiers emerging as a key driver. Urban Company&rsquo;s international business, in the UAE and Singapore, also grew 63.9 percent to Rs 147 crore in revenue. The UAE arm turned EBITDA positive in FY25 with a Rs 1.7 crore profit, even as overall international operations posted an EBITDA loss of a Rs 36.8 crore. The company exited direct operations in Saudi Arabia during the year, transitioning to a 50:50 joint venture with SMASCO.",

      "news_content": "Kuku FM, the audiobook and content aggregator platform, is in advanced talks to raise about $70 million (around Rs 600 crore) in a fresh round led by Granite Asia, sources told Moneycontrol, as demand for bite-sized content like Kuku TV rises among users and attracts investors to the space. Singapore-based Granite Asia (formerly called Granite Global Ventures) is a multi-asset investment platform and is looking to increase its India exposure by backing Kuku FM. &ldquo;Granite Asia will most likely lead Kuku FM&rsquo;s latest round with a $50 million cheque,&rdquo; one of the persons cited above said. The remaining, $20 million or so, will come from existing investors like Fundamentum Partnership, IFC and others, sources added. The fresh funds will come entirely in the form of primary capital. Talks are still underway so the round&rsquo;s construct may change slightly. Kuku FM, Granite Asia, IFC and Fundamentum Partnership did not reply to Moneycontrol&rsquo;s queries. Valuation boost During the ongoing negotiations, Kuku FM is commanding a valuation of $500 million, nearly 3X higher from around $177 million in September 2023. Kuku FM has grown significantly in the past months which has helped propel its valuation. &ldquo;The company is currently doing $10 million in monthly revenue which translates to an annualised revenue run rate of $120 million, doubling on a year-on-year (YoY) basis,&rdquo; a source told Moneycontrol. Micro-payments, including money from UPI auto payment mandates, have boosted Kuku FM&rsquo;s topline over the past months. Competitive landscape Kuku FM will use the fresh proceeds to expand its offerings and include more regional content. It will also grow its creator base so it can provide more engaging content on its platform and keep users hooked for longer. The Bengaluru-based company is focussing on retention at a time when micro-drama startups are mushrooming in the space. Kuku FM, which has so far raised around $73 million from India Quotient, 3one4 Capital, Vertex Ventures and others, is stitching together its largest round and will look to extend its lead over emerging micro-drama platforms such as Chai Shots, ReelSaga ShareChat&rsquo;s QuickTV, Reelies, and more. The company, founded in 2018 by Lal Chand Bisu, Vikas Goyal and Vinod Meena, will also look to consolidate its position and go ahead of arch rival Lightspeed-backed Pocket FM.",

      "news_title": "Fintech NBFC Techfino raises Rs 65 cr from Stellaris, Saison Capital to double down on secured MSME...",
      "news_content": "Bengaluru-based NBFC fintech Techfino has raised Rs 65 crore in fresh equity funding from Stellaris Venture Partners and Saison Capital, the venture arm of Tokyo-listed Credit Saison, to expand its secured lending business for underserved micro and small enterprises across India. The funding will be used to double Techfino&rsquo;s branch network from 30 to 60 branches in the next 12 months, expand its team, and strengthen its proprietary technology platform built to assess credit risk in Bharat&rsquo;s semi-urban corridors. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been profitable since our first full year of operations, and our core strength has been a tight grip on asset quality,&rdquo; said Rajesh Panda, Co-founder of Techfino. &ldquo;This fundraise is purely equity and will be used to drive growth through branch-led expansion and people hiring, especially for our MSME loan against property business.&rdquo; Founded in 2019 by Rajesh Panda (former Standard Chartered), Jayaprakash Patra (former ICICI, ING), and Ratikant Satapathy (former Bajaj Finance), Techfino operates two business verticals: unsecured education loans through a B2B2C model, and a secured MSME lending business. While the education business remains steady, the company is now focused on scaling up secured disbursements. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already crossed Rs 100 crore AUM in secured loans and are disbursing over Rs 10 crore every month. With this funding, we expect to double that monthly run-rate,&rdquo; said Panda. Techfino provides Loan Against Property (LAP) to small businesses like kirana shops, dairy entrepreneurs, village traders in Tier 2 and 3 cities across Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The average loan ticket size ranges from Rs 8&ndash;12 lakh, with household income underwriting tailored to informal-sector borrowers. &ldquo;Our typical borrower may be running a small grocery store while another family member works in a private firm. We assess household income holistically and build region-specific underwriting scorecards,&rdquo; explained Satapathy, highlighting their granular approach. As per the team, what differentiates the NBFC is its in-house tech stack, built from scratch to streamline risk assessment and disbursal. The platform integrates multiple APIs for bank statement analysis, property verification, and legal diligence reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving accuracy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built proprietary scorecards for property, bureau, and banking data and have embedded legal checks into the system. This allows us to underwrite rural borrowers with the same speed and precision as urban fintechs,&rdquo; said Satapathy. The company has already disbursed over 1 lakh loans across both verticals and now commands a total AUM of Rs 200 crore. Investor Stellaris believes this approach unlocks a massive untapped opportunity. &ldquo;Techfino has demonstrated that it is possible to build a high-quality, profitable lending business in this otherwise risky segment with strong underwriting and tech-enablement,&rdquo; said Ritesh Banglani, Partner at Stellaris Venture Partners. &ldquo;The formalisation of small businesses via UPI and GST is paving the way for scalable, tech-led MSME lending.&rdquo; While the unsecured education vertical, partnering with over 100 institutions like Manipal and Amity, continues to operate profitably, the company says the capital intensity is now shifting towards the secured side. &ldquo;Education lending will continue at a steady pace, but we see humongous growth ahead in MSME LAP. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re doubling down,&rdquo; said Panda. With strong bank partnerships for liabilities and a focus on suburban and rural expansion, Techfino expects to close FY26 with a robust secured loan book and sustainable profitability.",

      "news_content": "Facebook parent Meta is looking to capitalise on India&rsquo;s fast-growing gaming industry by providing developers access to advertising tools, expert mentorship and strategic guidance to help scale their businesses globally. On June 17, the social networking giant announced the launch of Meta Gaming Accelerator, an incubator designed for emerging game developers and studios in India. The initiative is being launched in partnership with four venture capital firms &mdash; Bitkraft Ventures, Elevation Capital, Kalaari Capital, and Lumikai Fund. &amp;quot;India&rsquo;s gaming community is a hotbed of creativity and innovation, but to unlock its full potential, we need to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity,&amp;quot; said Arun Srinivas, managing director and head, Meta India, in a statement. In its launch phase, the three-month-long programme will support 20 to 30 emerging Indian developers and studios through a structured curriculum offering guidance on monetisation, user acquisition and cross-border scaling. It will also focus on artificial intelligence (AI)-led game development, with an emphasis on how developers can integrate Meta&rsquo;s AI tools, including Llama, into their game creation and optimisation processes. This comes amid Meta's broader efforts to promote adoption of its Llama AI models in India, which is home to one of the world&rsquo;s largest developer bases. &amp;quot;By combining expert sessions from Meta with structured guidance from the country&rsquo;s top venture capital firms, we hope to not just empower local success stories but also create a launchpad for Indian gaming companies to scale globally&amp;quot; Srinivas said. Game on India is one of the fastest-growing gaming markets in the world. According to a report by Lumikai, the country&rsquo;s gaming industry generated $3.8 billion in revenue in FY24, marking a 22.6 percent year-over-year increase. The market is projected to exceed $9.2 billion by FY29, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent over the next five years. &amp;quot;At Bitkraft Ventures, we have a front-row seat to the explosive global growth of the gaming industry over the years, with a portfolio that spans over 140 companies across six continents. Yet, for emerging gaming markets like India, there is a big opportunity and need for the ecosystem to come together and help small and medium gaming companies&amp;quot; said Anuj Tandon, partner, Bitkraft Ventures. Kalaari Capital partner Vamshi Reddy also mentioned that India's gaming industry &amp;quot;needs more interventions to reach its full potential&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;We&rsquo;ve seen time and again that young companies with access to timely guidance, strategic resources, and a supportive ecosystem are better equipped to overcome growth hurdles and achieve success...This programme directly addresses the scaling challenges faced by indie studios and offers unparalleled access to Meta&rsquo;s experts, paving a clear path for sustained growth in this dynamic market,&amp;quot; he said. Meta India&rsquo;s top executives have earlier pledged their commitment to playing a key role in the growth of the sector, citing a &ldquo;big opportunity&rdquo; in a market projected to reach 700 million gamers by 2028. Gaming is among the top three verticals for the company globally. &ldquo;India is a key part of Meta&rsquo;s global gaming strategy, and we&rsquo;re committed to fostering innovation and growth within the developer community here,&rdquo; Sandhya Devanathan, Vice President (India and South East Asia), Meta, said in an industry event in October 2024. &amp;quot;Advertising is a crucial component for creators and developers to scale their businesses, especially in markets like India. Our platforms provide the tools needed to reach a global audience and grow sustainably through effective monetisation,&amp;quot; she said at the event. Meta's India unit gross advertising revenue grew to Rs 22,730.7 crore in the financial year 2024, up 24 percent from the previous year. The company benefited from growth in online advertising, fuelled by rising digital adoption in the country. Net profit rose 43 percent to Rs 504.93 crore and revenue from operations grew 9.3 percent to Rs 3,034.8 crore.",

The tech giant also said its Play Protect pilot, launched in October, has blocked nearly 60 million attempts to install high-risk apps on Android devices across the country. These apps, which could have infected devices or stolen data, were stopped in 13 million devices and involved over 2.2 lakh unique apps flagged before causing any harm. The data shared by Google was part of its &ldquo;Safety Charter for India&rdquo; unveiled on June 17 to outline how the tech giant is using artificial intelligence (AI) to secure the country&rsquo;s fast-growing digital economy. &amp;quot;India's digital journey continues to unlock incredible opportunities, but we also see the rise of sophisticated online threats evolving at machine speed,&amp;quot; said Heather Adkins, vice president of engineering, Google Security. &amp;quot;Our safety charter represents a comprehensive blueprint where AI isn't just narrowing the gap between attackers and defenders &mdash; it's eliminating it in some cases.&amp;quot; Indian entities are expected to lose Rs 20,000 crore to cybercrimes in 2025, if unchecked, a report by cybersecurity intelligence firm CloudSEK has said.

Collaboration with IIT-Madras In cybersecurity R&amp;amp;amp;D, Google announced a collaboration with IIT-Madras to advance Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), aiming to build smarter privacy protections and secure digital interactions for the future. Google and IIT-M partnered in 2022, when the US technology giant joined as a &ldquo;platinum consortium&rdquo; member of the institute's Centre for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (CeRAI), marking its commitment with an initial investment of $1 million. Last year, to improve Indic LLM capabilities, the company expanded its Gemini AI language testing to 29 Indian languages and developed a benchmark called IndicGenBench to evaluate AI safety and accuracy in the Indian context. The benchmark helps evaluate the generative capabilities of Indic LLMs. Also read: DoT introduces 'Financial Fraud Risk Indicator' to fight cyber fraud DigiKavach Beyond financial safety measures, Google in February partnered with home ministry&rsquo;s Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to expand its anti-scam initiative DigiKavach in a phased rollout over the next few months. The company&rsquo;s AI safeguards are also being built into core products. For instance, Google Messages now blocks over 500 million scam texts a month in India, and more than 2.5 billion warnings have been issued for unsafe links, processed entirely on-device to ensure privacy. To strengthen threat detection, Google is deploying AI-assisted red teaming, where AI models simulate attacks against each other to identify vulnerabilities, alongside rigorous adversarial testing. These tools are part of its broader effort to embed responsible AI principles directly into enterprise and government digitization projects in India, the company said. &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s surfaces and platforms are just one component of a vast digital ecosystem&hellip; Safety is a shared responsibility,&rdquo; the company said, noting that it is working with the Department of Telecom, SEBI, and various government agencies to tackle rising online threats.",

      "news_title": "The missing middle in India&rsquo;s startup ecosystem",
      "news_content": "By Ujwal Sutaria  India&rsquo;s startup success is often judged by the number of unicorns, billion-dollar valuations, and headline-grabbing fundraises. These companies dominate media narratives and reflect the aspirational energy of Indian entrepreneurship. But behind the noise, another kind of story is quietly unfolding. One that is no less impactful yet often overlooked. This is the story of capital-efficient startups. These are founder-led companies that scale steadily to ₹100&ndash;₹200 crore in revenue, operate with tight fundamentals, and create meaningful value through well-timed exits. While they may not feature on magazine covers, they are quietly building the foundation of a more sustainable and mature startup ecosystem. I call this segment the &ldquo;missing middle.&rdquo; Why the Missing Middle Matters As a micro-VC focused on early-stage investing, I have seen this segment produce some of the most reliable, risk-adjusted returns. These businesses are built on strong unit economics, not vanity metrics. They solve specific problems, operate with discipline, and grow without relying on excessive capital. In a market where funding is harder to raise and exits remain elusive, the missing middle is emerging as a credible path to value creation. For a fund writing ₹1&ndash;3 crore cheques, a ₹300 crore exit that delivers 10x returns is far more meaningful than holding a diluted stake in a unicorn that may never list. Repeat this outcome three or four times across a portfolio, and you have returned the fund with solid credibility. Let&rsquo;s break that down. If a ₹20 crore fund invests ₹1 crore each in 20 companies, a 3x return requires ₹60 crore in total exits. If even 5&ndash;6 of those portfolio companies achieve ₹50&ndash;100 crore in revenue and exit at ₹300&ndash;500 crore valuations, and the fund entered at a ₹20&ndash;30 crore valuation, a 10x return per winning company is well within reach &mdash; even after accounting for dilution. These companies are often less prone to failure because they focus on fundamentals, not fundraising momentum. More importantly, these exits create a compounding effect. Why Early Exits Matter India has already seen several success stories that validate this thesis. Minimalist, a skincare brand founded in 2020, was acquired by Hindustan Unilever for ₹2,950 crores. With a lean structure and a ₹500 crore run rate, it delivered stellar returns to founders and investors while maintaining capital efficiency. Yogabar&rsquo;s phased acquisition by ITC showed how niche brands with a clear mission and limited funding can build loyal audiences and exit on their own terms. ZingHR, a B2B SaaS platform acquired by Tata Capital for ₹500 crore, and Pickrr, acquired in a deal that highlighted the growing value of logistics tech, are further proof points. Clovia, Sportskeeda, and Togai have also delivered meaningful returns through strategic exits. These companies share a few things in common. They are customer-centric, operationally focused, and built with purpose. Their exits were strategic and well-aligned with acquirers seeking to expand capabilities or enter new markets. These are not one-off wins. They are the result of deliberate execution. Yet the broader narrative around Indian startups remains binary. A company is either a unicorn or it is not. It either scales to a billion dollars or is considered a missed opportunity. This narrow view overlooks many successful outcomes and discourages founders from optimizing for sustainable growth. It also limits how LPs, accelerators, and co-investors evaluate success. Why Micro-VCs Have an Edge Micro-VCs are often closest to the founders. We are involved early, without the burden of large fund dynamics. When a startup exits for ₹300 crores, it can create life-changing wealth for the founding team and meaningful returns for early investors. These are outcomes worth celebrating. However, over the last decade, Indian venture capital has often focused on backing category leaders at all costs. This has sometimes come at the expense of profitability and discipline. The funding slowdown in 2022 and 2023 forced a reset. Down rounds, flat rounds, and investor fatigue became common. Unicorns became harder to fund, and liquidity for early-stage investors became even more scarce. This shift led to a growing recognition. A ₹100 crore revenue business generating ₹10 crore in profit and exiting at ₹300&ndash;₹500 crore can be a better outcome than a ₹5,000 crore unicorn with no clear path to IPO. While IPOs are seen as the ultimate exit, they often require a fund to hold on for 8 to 10 years. Though lately, we are seeing this timeline shrinking as well and expect it to continue shrinking further. However, during that time, pro-rata investments, bridge rounds, and dilution can erode value. In many cases, companies now go public at valuations lower than their last private round, leaving late-stage investors with losses and early-stage investors with little to show. For the missing middle to thrive, three systemic shifts are needed. First, limited partners should evaluate fund performance based on DPI and time to liquidity, not just the number of unicorns. Second, accelerators and incubators must start celebrating ₹100 crore businesses as wins, not fallback stories. Third, founders must start thinking like owners. They need to recognize when to take money off the table instead of raising the next round by default. At TDV Partners, we guide founders to build with optionality. We encourage them to focus on business fundamentals, while also being open to strategic exits. We tell them it is perfectly okay if the journey ends at ₹200 crores, as long as they own enough of it and know when to step back. A New Playbook for the Next Decade The next wave of Indian startup success will not be written by unicorns alone. It will be shaped by founders who build disciplined ₹100&ndash;₹200 crore businesses, and by early believers who had the conviction to back them. The missing middle is not a flaw in the system. It is a powerful and under-recognized engine of startup growth in India. Early exits are not a step down. They are milestones. They unlock capital, create new entrepreneurs, and strengthen the ecosystem. Over the next decade, India will likely see more such stories &mdash; not just in consumer and SaaS, but in fintech, healthtech, climate tech, and manufacturing. The smart capital will follow founders who build with intention, who optimize for outcomes, and who are willing to exit when the timing and value are right. Micro-VCs must learn to recognize when to cash in and move forward. It is not just about identifying potential but knowing when to realize it. With growing interest from private equity firms, family offices, and secondary funds, the exit landscape is stronger than ever. A timely exit is not just about liquidity. It enables faster capital recycling, builds a track record for general partners, and frees up time and energy to support the next generation of winners.

      "news_title": "Razorpay enters consumer UPI space, leads $30 million investment in payments platform POP",
      "news_content": "Fintech unicorn Razorpay has invested around $30 million in consumer payments platform POP, marking a strategic push to tap into India&rsquo;s rapidly expanding consumer UPI market. The new funding will be used to strengthen POP&rsquo;s product offerings, expand its merchant partnerships in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) and lifestyle categories, and enhance consumer rewards through its POPcoins program. &amp;quot;The investment aligns with the company&rsquo;s focus on helping D2C merchants drive customer loyalty. POP bridges a critical gap by combining instant rewards, seamless payments, and brand discovery in a single platform,&rdquo; said Razorpay Co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur in a media statement on June 17. Launched in June 2024, POP operates a unified payments interface (UPI) app focused on a rewards-driven model. The platform integrates payments, commerce, and credit offerings, allowing users to earn POPcoins, a multi-brand, brand-funded rewards currency, on every transaction. The firm said that POPcoins can be redeemed for discounts across a growing network of merchant partners. Within its first year, POP has scaled to over six lakh daily UPI transactions and reached more than one million unique monthly active users. The company has also fulfilled over two lakh monthly commerce shipments and issued more than 40,000 RuPay credit cards in partnership with Yes Bank. &ldquo;India doesn't need another cashback-only app. With Razorpay&rsquo;s support, we aim to build a loyalty-first payments ecosystem that helps businesses scale with purpose and impact,&amp;quot; POP Founder Bhargav Errangi said. As per the NPCI database, POP is currently the 21st largest UPI player in the country, processing 13.6 million transactions in May 2025, with a total transaction value exceeding Rs 500 crore. This move follows Razorpay&rsquo;s earlier acquisition of PoshVine, strengthening its loyalty and rewards capabilities under Razorpay Engage. India&rsquo;s UPI market continues to be dominated by PhonePe and Google Pay, which together account for over 80% of UPI transaction volumes. Other players like Paytm and Amazon Pay hold smaller shares of the market. New players are steadily entering the space to carve out differentiated niches. Just last month, fintech startup Jar announced its entry into UPI Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) services, partnering with BharatPe as the Technology Service Provider (TSP) and Unity Small Finance Bank as the Payment Service Provider (PSP), indicating growing competition in the consumer UPI landscape. This also comes at a time when there is an ongoing debate on MDR or Merchant Discount Rate. Last week, the Union finance ministry dismissed reports of government planning to levy merchant discount rate (MDR) on large-ticket UPI transactions. Earlier this year, the Payment Council of India had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to reconsider Zero MDR policy for UPI transactions. As on June 1, UPI had recorded 644 million transactions and 650 million the next day, overtaking global payments giant Visa, which processed an average of 639 million daily transactions during FY24.",

      "news_title": "The cost of Y Combinator backing? Meesho, Razorpay, Groww to cumulatively pay $600 million in taxes",
      "news_content": "Several marquee Indian startups, celebrated as Y Combinator success stories, are now paying a steep price for having followed the accelerator&rsquo;s playbook too closely. Meesho, Razorpay, and Groww, all formerly domiciled in Delaware, United States, collectively have to shell out nearly $600 million in taxes to shift their headquarters back to India as they prepare for public listings on domestic bourses. The hefty tax payouts stem from what industry stakeholders now describe as a costly detour, driven by a mix of Silicon Valley allure, VC nudges, and Y Combinator&rsquo;s own terms. Indian homegrown e-commerce startup, Meesho, had to domicile in US&rsquo; Delaware during its early days in 2016. Being based in the US was a requirement to be eligible for Y Combinator's accelerator programme. In exchange, the investor offered startups up to $500,000 in seed funding, a good push to help get things off the ground. But now, as Meesho gears up for an IPO in India, the e-commerce company is preparing to pay $288 million (Rs 2,461 crore) to the US government to unwind that structure &mdash; one of the largest tax outgoes for an Indian startup in recent memory, second only to PhonePe&rsquo;s $1 billion tax bill in 2023, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported on June 16. Similarly, fintech unicorn Razorpay, which also plans to go public in India over the next two years, is on the hook for around Rs 1,245 crore ($150 million) in tax liabilities. In October 2024, stock broking and investment platform Groww had paid around Rs 1,340 crore ($160 million) to complete its reverse flip. Together, the three startups have paid, or are in the advanced stages of paying almost $600 million to undo their Delaware-based corporate structures, a sobering price tag for having once chased the prestige of a US base. The Delaware detour Much of this trend traces back to Y Combinator&rsquo;s standard policy: startups accepted into the programme are expected to incorporate in one of four jurisdictions &mdash; the US (typically Delaware), Cayman Islands, Canada, or Singapore. For Indian founders, that often meant flipping their homegrown entity into a US holding company and making the Indian operations a subsidiary. Intellectual property, too, was typically held abroad, making future returns taxable there. Higher chances of raising follow-on capital was another key point that YC made while convincing founders to incorporate in the US. &ldquo;Somewhere, there&rsquo;s been this mindset among Indian founders that being American adds credibility &mdash; it&rsquo;s almost like a complex,&rdquo; said Anand Lunia, General Partner at India Quotient. &ldquo;Even VCs have believed that founders will think bigger if they visit the Bay Area.&amp;quot; According to industry watchers, that line of thinking was especially common between 2013 and 2019, when many Indian startups were advised by their investors to incorporate overseas. The hope: easier access to global capital, lighter regulation, and smoother exits via secondary sales or overseas IPOs. &ldquo;Socially, it&rsquo;s seen as more acceptable to fail as a US-based founder than as an Indian one,&rdquo; Lunia added. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not place all the blame on Y Combinator.&rdquo; A seasoned founder-turned-investor, who requested anonymity, also pointed out that YC was not the only one to blame and even venture capitalists often drove the push to flip. &ldquo;Founders would listen to their investors, and incoming global investors often preferred an overseas domicile. The tax and regulatory regimes abroad were perceived to be more founder-friendly at the time,&rdquo; this investor told Moneycontrol. Lunia agreed: &ldquo;Do you really think these high-quality founders flipped their domicile just for YC&rsquo;s $250-$500K? It wasn&rsquo;t just that. Many of their VCs also pushed them to shift overseas.&rdquo; For a while, the strategy worked. But as the US IPO window narrowed and Indian public markets opened up to tech listings, the rationale for being US-based started to fade. Meanwhile, Indian regulators began tightening oversight, particularly in sectors like fintech, and tax authorities grew wary of structures designed to shift IP or profits abroad. And then, most founders eventually realised that &ldquo;flipping was a very expensive mistake,&rdquo; the investor, cited above, said bluntly. What the flip? A reverse flip involves transferring ownership and assets back to an Indian entity, often triggering tax liabilities on capital gains and valuation differentials. These liabilities can be owed either to Indian or foreign governments, depending on where the gains are recognised and where the IP is held. Razorpay, for instance, plans to fund its Rs 1,245 crore tax outgo using internal reserves and is not raising fresh capital to cover the liability, Moneycontrol had reported earlier. Meesho, meanwhile, will pay its entire $288 million bill to US tax authorities, standard procedure when exiting a Delaware structure, from the capital it raised in April last year. Downturn in YC interest The tax bills are now also prompting a rethink among Indian founders. Once viewed as a coveted badge of honour, an acceptance into Y Combinator no longer holds the same cachet &mdash; especially if it comes with a multi-million-dollar headache years down the line. In 2021, YC&rsquo;s summer and winter batches saw 74 Indian startups make the cut. By 2024, that number had dropped to just nine across both batches &mdash; an 88 percent decline in three years, according to Y Combinator's website. So far in 2025, only four Indian startups have been accepted into the program. &ldquo;Founders are aware now, and this problem is becoming less acute,&rdquo; Lunia said. &ldquo;I expect far fewer cases of Indian startups flipping early and then paying huge tax amounts to come back.&rdquo; The San Francisco shift Still, exceptions remain. AI-focused startups, many of which rely heavily on US capital, cutting-edge infrastructure, and deep talent pools, are bucking the trend. In fact, AI-first founders are actively moving in the opposite direction, and not just on paper. As Moneycontrol reported earlier, several SaaS and AI entrepreneurs are not only setting up overseas entities but physically relocating to San Francisco to be closer to the epicentre of the AI boom. Founders like Arvind Parthiban (SuperOps), Vijay Rayapati (Atomicwork), Soham Ganatra (Composio), Vignesh Girishankar (RocketLane), Siva Rajamani (Everstage), and Vengat Krishnaraj (Klenty) are among those packing their bags &mdash; some permanently, others for extended stints. The gravitational pull of artificial intelligence is simply too strong to resist. But for those with India-first markets and IPO ambitions, the message is clear: flipping comes at a cost, and it&rsquo;s often paid in millions.",

      "news_title": "Blockchain firms come to India for &lsquo;daily active user farming&rsquo;, says Polygon&rsquo;s Sandeep Nailwal",
      "news_content": "Global blockchain firm Polygon&rsquo;s co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said that major blockchain companies are increasingly eyeing India in the recent years for &ldquo;daily active user (DAU) farming&rdquo;. This helps them inflate their user base numbers, as the country accounts for one of the largest Web3 developer bases globally. This tactic was deployed by Polygon too during its early days in 2017-2018, to get more developers to build on their chain, Nailwal told Moneycontrol. &ldquo;Quite frankly, a lot of projects that come to India stay for a year or two. What they do is very similar to what we call DAU farming in the Web2 world farming,&rdquo; Nailwal said. &ldquo;Many companies come to India, get 10&ndash;20 million users, and then claim they have 50 million users globally. But out of that, 30&ndash;40 million are low-paying or even free Indian users, and only 10 million are actual paying users elsewhere,&rdquo; he said. According to a recent report by Web3 venture capital firm Hashed Emergent, India accounted for nearly 17 percent of new developers entering the Web3 space in 2024. It is expected to go past the US to emerge as the world's largest developer community by 2028. India is also home to the world&rsquo;s second-largest crypto developer base, with 11.8 percent of the developers based in the country, despite the government&rsquo;s cautious approach towards the sector. Nailwal said that crypto firms do &ldquo;daily active developer farming.  They would give small grants and ask you to build something on their node and all that.&rdquo; In the past few years, several global blockchain projects -- be it Layer 1, Layer 2 or multi-chain -- have expanded to India. Some of the prominent long-term names include Solana, Polygon, Algorand, Polkadot, Aptos, Avalanche. There are smaller projects, too. Layer 1 refers to a base blockchain protocol, (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) while Layer 2 is a third-party protocol built to have integrated functionality and use cases over the base blockchain. How Polygon did it Nailwal said that Polygon was one of the earliest blockchain companies to organise hackathons in India in 2017. The firm had given out massive amount of grants and investments back then, he said. &ldquo;I personally must have invested around $15 million, probably close to Rs 100 crore, into various projects. I had an open-door policy for anyone doing anything in crypto in India. If a founder reached out and didn&rsquo;t seem like a shaky character, I would do an angel investment of Rs 10-20 lakh,&rdquo; he said. Nailwal added, &ldquo;Do something, use my name, go out, raise more money and all that. A lot of Indian founders could not go global and do that global storytelling. You need to go global because the local market is off limits for you because of the regulations.&rdquo; Polygon&rsquo;s investment rationale Over the years, Polygon has shifted its strategy to invest in very select and &ldquo;focused founders.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are not looking at a huge number of hackathons, college kids trying their hands on,&rdquo; Nailwal said, adding that Polygon relied on hackathons when EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) was new &ndash; the firm&rsquo;s foundational technology. Back then, Polygon needed to build things from a grassroot level to create awareness among developers, but now there are enough number of developers on EVM, he shared. Sharing his investment strategy, Nailwal said: &ldquo;We now look for founders we think can do really, really good. Then we do bigger investments in them. Instead of spraying and paying like $100,000 or Rs 1-2 crore, and spending it on hackathons, we would actually take Rs 50 lakh or Rs 1 crore and give it to two or three founders who have the mettle in them.&rdquo; &ldquo;We still invest in India; in fact, invest more than before, but we do very selective, pinpointed and more thesis-based deals,&rdquo; he added. On the business front, Nailwal recently joined back Polygon Foundation as the CEO after a two-year hiatus. The company is in the midst of an internal restructuring and revamping of the business model and offerings.

      "ai_summary": "Polygon's co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, reveals blockchain companies are using \"DAU farming\" in India to inflate user base numbers. He says firms attract 10-20 million Indian users, then claim 50 million globally. India holds 17% of new Web3 developers in 2024 and is expected to be the largest developer community by 2028. Polygon, in its early days, invested $15 million in Indian projects to foster developer growth, but now focuses on select founders."
